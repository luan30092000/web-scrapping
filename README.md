# STAT260_Assignment_Lab
## Lab 1
Worked with library dplyr, gapminder
Summarized data 
Plot data using `ggplot` with `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth`
Filter data using 'filter'
## Lab 2
Analyzed data given by instructor with `library(tidyverse)`
1. Plot time series of HIV prevalence by year for each country, analyze the purpose of `alpha`
2. Filtered data and make sub data set, plots sub data overlap with old data but highlight for a more clear data representation
## Lab 3
1. Plot data from lab 2, and analyzed the differences between `geom_line()` and `geom_smooth()`.
2. Make new plot with group of countries with high hiv and the rest, added layers of `geom_smooth()` for 2 group (high hiv and the whole world)
